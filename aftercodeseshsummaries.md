# * **Summary of Today's Progress:**

Today, we laid the foundational groundwork for our D&D 5e character sheet backend in Python. Our primary focus was on the core representation of a character through the `Character` module. We achieved the following:

* **Created the `Character` Class:** This class now stores essential character information like name, race, background, alignment, and base ability scores.
* **Implemented Attribute Score and Modifier Calculation:** We added methods to calculate the effective ability score, taking into account base scores and modifiers from various sources (level-ups, equipment, boons, curses, and overrides), and to derive the standard ability score modifier.
* **Established a Basic Leveling System:** The `add_level` and `reduce_level` methods allow us to track a character's class levels and update their proficiency bonus accordingly. We also included a `level_history` for potential future use in reverting level-based changes.
* **Handled Feats and Attribute Overrides:** We added functionality to store character feats and to manage temporary or permanent overrides to ability scores from equipment or other effects, including tracking the source of these overrides.
* **Set Up a System for Tracking Bonus/Penalty Sources:** We refined how equipment, boon, and curse modifiers are stored to include the source of the effect, allowing for more precise management.
* **Prepared for Audited Logging:** We introduced a placeholder logging function as a stepping stone towards a more robust logging system.
* **Discussed Future Scalability:** We considered important aspects like handling level reduction, free actions, rest mechanics, prepared spells, damage output information, and the flexibility for homebrew content.

**How Tomorrow's Step Ties In:**

Tomorrow, we will begin to develop the `Class` module and enhance the `Character` module to handle skill proficiencies. This next step directly builds upon the foundation we established today in the following ways:

* **Class Levels Inform Proficiencies:** The levels we are tracking in the `Character` module are directly tied to the proficiencies a character gains from their class. The `Class` module will define which proficiencies are granted at each level.
* **Expanding Character Abilities:** Just as we defined how ability scores are managed today, tomorrow we will start to define another key aspect of what a character *can do* by tracking their skill proficiencies.
* **Preparing for Actions and Spells:** Understanding a character's class levels and proficiencies is a crucial prerequisite for determining their available actions and spells, which will be the focus of the `ActionSpell` module we'll tackle in the future.

By developing the `Class` module and integrating skill proficiencies into the `Character` module, we will be adding another essential layer to our character representation, moving beyond just raw stats to encompass their learned skills and class-based abilities.
