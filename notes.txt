I need to do a whole rewrite of this code.
I think I got as far as I could w/ Gemini's help. Let's start by reworking the side scripts like Class, Race, Background, etc.


already rewrote race. Working on class now, next on the list is a rewrite on backgrounds, and then character.

rewrote class, just need to populate out all of phb14's classes

don't have to rewrite backgorunds at all. Just needed to abstract out rulebook listings and flesh out phb14 backgrounds

I should probably consider an initialization test option, to verify that all packages are valid. Verify if the resources all have valid fields, and that creating a character across all permutations don't error out, and have valid stats.
