class Traits:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
# These should probably function a lot like userexits, or functionally be searched for based on general usage, ie, health searches for dwarven toughness, speed stuff looks for it's related traits etc. Although, I'd rather just add the trait and have it work out of box. So possibly having other registered lists might be key to making it work, ie, like registered classes, but to organize them w/ a decorator list.
