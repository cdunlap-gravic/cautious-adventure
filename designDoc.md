## Design Document: D&D 5e Character Sheet Backend

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the design for the backend logic of a D&D 5e character sheet application. The primary goals are to support multiclassing, a dynamic action and spell pool based on character levels, and a battle round manager that provides context-aware options. The focus of this initial design is solely on the backend implementation, independent of any graphical user interface.

**2. Goals**

* **Multiclassing Support:** The system must accurately represent characters with levels in multiple classes, correctly applying class features, spell slots, and proficiencies.
* **Programmable Action and Spell Pool:** The system should dynamically determine the available actions and spells based on the character's class(es) and level(s). This should be extensible to accommodate various class features and magical items.
* **Battle Round Management:** The backend should track available actions, bonus actions, reactions, and movement during a combat round and provide information on what the character can currently do.
* **Dice Roll and Modifier Output:** When an action or spell is selected, the system should output the appropriate dice to roll and any relevant modifiers to add.
* **Data Persistence (Future Consideration):** While not the primary focus today, the design should consider potential future integration with data storage (e.g., JSON, databases) to save and load character data.

**3. System Architecture**

The backend will be primarily object-oriented, utilizing classes to represent core D&D concepts. The main modules will likely include:

* **Character Module:** Responsible for storing and managing all character-specific data (attributes, skills, levels, etc.).
* **Class Module:** Defines the properties and features of each D&D 5e class, including level-based progression (spell slots, features, proficiencies).
* **Race Module:** Defines racial traits and bonuses.
* **ActionSpell Module:** Manages the available actions and spells for the character, dynamically updating based on class and level.
* **Combat Module:** Handles the tracking of combat rounds, available actions, and initiative.
* **Rule Engine:** Contains the logic for applying D&D 5e rules (e.g., calculating proficiency bonus, determining spell slots).

**4. Module Breakdown**

**4.1. Character Module**

* **`Character` Class:**
    * Attributes: `strength`, `dexterity`, `constitution`, `intelligence`, `wisdom`, `charisma` (each potentially an object holding base score and modifiers).
    * Basic Information: `name`, `race`, `background`, `alignment`, `hit_points` (current, max, temp), `armor_class`, `initiative_bonus`, `speed`.
    * Levels: A dictionary or list to store class levels (e.g., `{"Fighter": 5, "Wizard": 3}`).
    * Proficiency Bonus: Calculated based on total level.
    * Saving Throws: Dictionary storing base saves and proficiency status.
    * Skills: Dictionary storing skill names, associated ability, and proficiency status.
    * Inventory (Initial Placeholder): A list to hold item objects (will be expanded later).

**4.2. Class Module**

* **Base `Class` Class:** Defines common properties for all classes (e.g., hit dice per level, saving throw proficiencies).
* **Specific Class Subclasses (e.g., `Fighter`, `Wizard`, `Rogue`):** Each subclass will inherit from the `Class` class and define class-specific features, level progressions (e.g., spell slots per level for spellcasters, extra attacks for fighters), and proficiencies. These classes will likely contain methods to determine what features are available at a given level.

**4.3. Race Module**

* **Base `Race` Class:** Defines common racial properties.
* **Specific Race Subclasses (e.g., `Human`, `Elf`, `Dwarf`):** Each subclass will define racial traits and ability score bonuses.

**4.4. ActionSpell Module**

* **`Action` Class:** Represents a generic action (e.g., Attack, Dash, Disengage). Contains attributes like name, description, action type (Action, Bonus Action, Reaction, Movement), and potentially a method to determine the dice roll and modifiers.
* **`Spell` Class:** Represents a spell. Contains attributes like name, level, school, casting time, range, components, duration, description, and a method to determine the dice roll and modifiers (if any).
* **`ActionSpellManager` Class:** This class will be responsible for:
    * Holding lists of available actions and spells for the character.
    * Dynamically populating these lists based on the character's classes and levels by querying the `Class` module.
    * Potentially handling spell slots and tracking usage.

**4.5. Combat Module**

* **`CombatManager` Class:**
    * Tracks the current combat round.
    * Manages the character's available actions, bonus actions, reactions, and movement for the current round.
    * Provides methods to "use" an action/spell and update the available resources.
    * Could potentially integrate with an initiative tracker in the future.

**4.6. Rule Engine**

* **`RuleEngine` Class (or potentially static methods):** Contains functions for:
    * Calculating proficiency bonus based on level.
    * Determining ability score modifiers.
    * Applying racial and class-based proficiencies.
    * Potentially handling more complex rule interactions in the future.

**5. Development Approach**

1.  **Core Character Representation:** Start by implementing the `Character` class and the basic attribute system.
2.  **Class and Race Implementation:** Implement the base `Class` and `Race` classes, followed by a few specific subclasses (e.g., Fighter, Wizard, Human, Elf). Focus on storing level-based features and proficiencies.
3.  **Proficiency and Rule Engine:** Implement the `RuleEngine` to calculate proficiency bonus and ability modifiers. Integrate this into the `Character` class.
4.  **Basic Action Implementation:** Create the `Action` class for standard actions like Attack and Movement.
5.  **Spell Implementation (Initial):** Create the `Spell` class and a basic structure for storing spell information.
6.  **`ActionSpellManager`:** Implement the logic within this class to determine available actions and a basic set of spells based on class and level. This will require querying the `Class` module.
7.  **Combat Module (Initial):** Implement the `CombatManager` to track basic action economy in a round.
8.  **Dice Roll and Modifier Output:** Implement methods within the `Action` and `Spell` classes (or a utility function) to determine and output the dice to roll and modifiers.
9.  **Multiclassing Integration:** Extend the `Character` class and the `ActionSpellManager` to correctly handle characters with multiple classes, merging proficiencies and determining available actions and spells based on the combined levels.

**6. Language Considerations: Python vs. C**

| Feature          | Python                                                                    | C                                                                         |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development Speed** | Faster development due to high-level syntax and extensive libraries.      | Slower development due to lower-level nature, manual memory management.       |
| **Readability** | Generally more readable and easier to understand.                        | Can be less readable, especially for complex logic, if not well-structured. |
| **Memory Management** | Automatic garbage collection simplifies memory management.                 | Manual memory management (allocation, deallocation) requires careful attention. |
| **Performance** | Can be slower for computationally intensive tasks due to interpreted nature. | Generally faster execution speed due to compiled nature and direct memory access. |
| **Libraries/Ecosystem** | Rich ecosystem of libraries for various tasks (data structures, etc.). | Smaller standard library; often requires external libraries for complex tasks. |
| **Learning Curve** | Easier to learn, especially for beginners.                             | Steeper learning curve, especially regarding memory management.             |
| **Integration** | Excellent for scripting and integration with other Python tools.           | Can interface with other languages but might require more effort.           |

**Considerations for this Project:**

* **Complexity of D&D Rules:** Implementing the intricacies of D&D 5e rules (especially around spellcasting and class features) will involve significant logical complexity. Python's readability and higher-level data structures (dictionaries, lists, classes) can make managing this complexity easier during development.
* **Focus on Backend Logic:** The primary goal is the backend logic. Performance is less critical at this stage than clarity and ease of implementation. Python's faster development cycle allows for quicker iteration and refinement of the core rules.
* **Potential GUI in Python:** Since you already have a Python-based GUI framework, sticking with Python for the backend would likely lead to smoother integration in the future.
* **No Immediate Performance Bottlenecks:** The character sheet application is unlikely to face performance bottlenecks that would necessitate the raw speed of C, at least in the initial stages focusing on data management and rule application.

**Recommendation for Initial Development:**

Given your current familiarity with Python, the desire for faster development to keep you engaged, and the nature of the project (primarily logical rule implementation), **Python appears to be the more suitable choice for the initial backend development.** You can always consider optimizing specific performance-critical sections in C later if necessary, though it's unlikely to be a major concern for this type of application.

**7. Future Considerations**

* **Data Persistence:** Implementing saving and loading of character data (e.g., using JSON or a database).
* **Item Management:** Expanding the inventory system with item properties and effects.
* **Feats and Traits:** Incorporating feats and racial traits into the character data and their effects on actions and abilities.
* **GUI Integration:** Connecting the backend logic to your existing Tkinter framework.
